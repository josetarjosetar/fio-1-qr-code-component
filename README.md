## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS

### What I learned

I learned how to center a card inside of a body vertically and horizontally with the following code snippet:

```css
body {
  background-color: hsl(212, 45%, 89%);
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
}
```

I learned how to make the body fill out the entire screen with the following code snippet.

```css
html,
body {
  margin: 0;
  height: 100%;
}
```

### Continued development

I'd like to continue practicing working on the layout of more complex components.
